🌍 Global Terrorism Data Analysis (1970–2017)
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory and analytical study of global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017 using Python.

The objective was to identify:

Long-term terrorism trends

High-risk countries and regions

Most active and deadliest terror groups

Target and weapon impact patterns

Decade-level shifts in terrorism activity

The analysis goes beyond simple counting by building composite Risk Indices and time-based intelligence models.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📊 Key Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed unnecessary columns

Handled missing values

Created Total_Casualty feature

Converted date columns properly

Optimized categorical data types

2️⃣ Time Series Analysis

Year-wise attack trends

5-Year rolling average

Year-over-Year growth rate

Decade-wise aggregation

Region vs Year heatmap

3️⃣ Country Risk Index

Built a weighted risk model using:

Total Attacks

Total Casualties

Average Casualty Per Attack

Applied Min-Max normalization and calculated composite Risk Score.

4️⃣ Region Risk Analysis

Identified high-risk regions

Compared intensity vs frequency

Observed geographic shift in terrorism hotspots

5️⃣ Terror Group Analysis

Most active groups

Deadliest groups

Most lethal per attack groups

Frequency vs severity comparison

6️⃣ Target Type Analysis

Most frequently targeted sectors

Highest casualty target categories

7️⃣ Weapon Type Analysis

Most used weapon types

Deadliest weapon categories

Casualty impact per weapon

🔎 Key Analytical Insights-

1️⃣ Terrorism activity shows clear cyclical patterns, with significant escalation after 2000 in multiple regions.

2️⃣ Certain regions exhibit low attack frequency but high per-attack lethality, indicating intensity-driven risk rather than volume-driven impact.

3️⃣ The Risk Index model reveals that frequency alone is not sufficient to assess threat level — casualty severity significantly changes rankings.

4️⃣ Some terror groups dominate through operational volume, while others cause disproportionate casualties per event.

5️⃣ Government and civilian sectors remain the most frequently targeted categories globally.

6️⃣ Explosives and firearms account for the majority of casualties, but certain less frequent weapon types show higher per-attack severity.

7️⃣ Decade analysis indicates shifting terrorism hotspots over time, reflecting geopolitical transformations.
